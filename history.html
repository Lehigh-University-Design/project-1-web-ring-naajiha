                        Importance of Bengali Language
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        In 1948, before Bangladesh was declared independent, there used to be an East(modern-day Bangladesh) and West Pakistan(modern-day Pakistan).  They declared that the federal language would be Urdu, though more than half the population (56%) spoke Bangla.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This move was to suppress the culture and opinions of the people of the East, "Cultural and linguistic differences between the two wings gradually outweighed any sense of religious unity. The Bengalis took great pride in their culture and language which, with its Bengali script and vocabulary, was unacceptable to the West Pakistani elite, who believed that it had assimilated considerable Hindu cultural influences".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This event ended up leading to a Genocide of the Bengali people in 1971, 3,000,000 dead, 400,000 women raped.
